# Milestone #1 Submission ([Link](https://blackboard.qut.edu.au/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_9209123_1&course_id=_154919_1&group_id=&mode=view))
__Milestone #1 is due at the end of Week 8. Only one member submits__ and the submission will need to cover:
- The requirement documents as it currently stands
- The detailed design document as it currently stands.
- The current plan for the next 2 weeks (sprint planning). Keep this realistic and achievable; and describe what each team member will be doing in that time.
- A video showing the progress (including showing the documents and the plan for the next
2 weeks.) Maximum length: 4 minutes.

The client may not have time to read the documents, so make sure __everything is covered in the video__. You can then use this submission to get some useful feedback on how you are going, to check that you are on the right track etc.

The maximum length for this video is __4 minutes__. If you submit a longer video, we will watch the first 4 minutes of it and give you marks based on that. You may want to rehearse what you are going to say and present in the video to keep within this time limit.
