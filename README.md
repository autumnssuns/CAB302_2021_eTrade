__Milestone #2 is due at the end of Week 10. Only one member submits__ and the submission will need to cover:
- The requirement documents as it currently stands
- The detailed design document as it currently stands.
- The current plan for the next 2 weeks (sprint planning). Keep this realistic and achievable; and describe what each team member will be doing in that time.
- A video showing the progress (including showing the documents and the plan for the next 2 weeks.) __Maximum length: 4 minutes.__

The client may not have time to read the documents, so make sure __everything is covered in the video__.
